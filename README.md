# Swap Shop
A very simple shop where you can buy or sell whatever you like! Inspired by shops in story-based computer games. A
full-stack app with a python console app front-end, Flask API app back-end and MySQL database.

## Instructions for running Swap Shop
1. Open the SQL script **swap-shop.sql** in MySQL Workbench and run all commands
2. Check **requirements.txt** for installation requirements
3. Change the **HOST**, **USER** and **PASSWORD** in **config.py** to match your own MySQL DB connection settings
4. Run db_utils.py
5. Run app.py
6. Run main.py

The app will run in the Python console. Follow the prompts to answer the questions and buy and sell from the shop!

### Notes:
If I was to develop this further I would like to make it possible to count multiple items and increase and decrease
stock levels.
